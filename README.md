# FINANCIAL-REPORT-POWER-BI
Financial report for a company from 2013 and 2014

In this report, I will analyze the financial data for a company from 2013 and 2014. The database includes critical information on selling prices, cost prices, profits, discounts offered, and units sold. Additionally, it provides details on the business segments, countries of operation, and the brands and products involved.

My analysis will focus on key metrics such as Profit, Sales, Units Sold, Cost, and Product. To facilitate easier visualization and provide users with actionable insights, I have incorporated filters for Year and Country into the report.

The Government segment significantly outperforms all other sectors, generating 65% of the company's profits and serving as the cornerstone of the business. Among the products, Paseo stands out as the top performer, accounting for 28% of the profit share. It leads in both sales volume and cost efficiency, making it a key part of the company's identity.

France contributes approximately 23% of the overall profit, making it the top-performing country in the rankings.

From 2013 to 2014, the business saw notable improvements in performance metrics such as units sold, sales revenue, and profit, reflecting substantial growth.

However, the Enterprise segment is a major concern, consistently reporting losses throughout the year. Management needs to investigate the underlying issues, starting with the immediate cessation of discounts offered to this segment to mitigate further losses. Identifying and addressing the root causes will be crucial for turning around this segment's performance.
